# mmu_des_y3_sne_ia HATS Catalog Collection

This is the collection of HATS catalogs representing mmu_des_y3_sne_ia.

This dataset is part of the [Multimodal Universe](https://github.com/MultimodalUniverse/MultimodalUniverse),
a large-scale collection of multimodal astronomical data. For full details, see the paper:
[The Multimodal Universe: Enabling Large-Scale Machine Learning with 100TBs of Astronomical Scientific Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02527).

### Access the catalog

We recommend the use of the [LSDB](https://lsdb.io) Python framework to access HATS catalogs.
LSDB can be installed via `pip install lsdb` or `conda install conda-forge::lsdb`,
see more details [in the docs](https://docs.lsdb.io/).
The following code provides a minimal example of opening this catalog:

```python
import lsdb

# Full sky coverage.
catalog = lsdb.open_catalog("https://huggingface.co/datasets/UniverseTBD/mmu_des_y3_sne_ia")
# One-degree cone.
catalog = lsdb.open_catalog(
    "https://huggingface.co/datasets/UniverseTBD/mmu_des_y3_sne_ia",
    search_filter=lsdb.ConeSearch(ra=35.0, dec=-6.0, radius_arcsec=3600.0),
)
```

Each catalog in this collection is represented as a separate [Apache Parquet dataset](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/dataset.html) and can be accessed with a variety of tools, including `pandas`, `pyarrow`, `dask`, `Spark`, `DuckDB`.

### Catalog columns

The main HATS catalog contains the following columns:

"Nested" indicates whether the column is stored as a nested field inside another "struct" column.


"Value count" may be different from the total number of rows for nested columns: each nested element is counted as a single value.




### Crossmatch with another catalog

HATS catalogs can be efficiently crossmatched using [LSDB](https://lsdb.io),
which leverages the HEALPix partitioning to avoid loading the full datasets into memory:

```python
import lsdb

mmu_des_y3_sne_ia = lsdb.open_catalog("https://huggingface.co/datasets/UniverseTBD/mmu_des_y3_sne_ia")
other = lsdb.open_catalog("https://huggingface.co/datasets/<org>/<other_catalog>")

crossmatched = mmu_des_y3_sne_ia.crossmatch(other, radius_arcsec=1.0)
print(crossmatched)
```

See the [LSDB documentation](https://docs.lsdb.io/) for more details on crossmatching and other operations.

### Dataset-specific context

**Original survey**  
This dataset is based on observations from the [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/), specifically the Year 3 supernova sample, and compiled as part of the [Pantheon+ compilation](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac8b7a/pdf). It contains spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae used for cosmological studies.

**Data modality**  
The dataset consists of light curves, i.e. time-series data including observation time, flux, flux error, and bandpass filter (griz). It also includes metadata such as redshift, coordinates, host galaxy mass, and supernova classification.

**Typical use cases**  
It is commonly used for photometric redshift prediction, light curve modeling, and inpainting tasks.

**Caveats**  
The dataset includes only spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae and is subject to selection cuts from the Pantheon+ compilation.

**Citation**  
Users should cite the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the associated Pantheon+ and DES supernova papers. The dataset is released under the CC BY 4.0 license, requiring attribution to the original authors.
