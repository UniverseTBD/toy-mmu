# mmu_ssl_legacysurvey_north HATS Catalog Collection

This is the collection of HATS catalogs representing mmu_ssl_legacysurvey_north.

This dataset is part of the [Multimodal Universe](https://github.com/MultimodalUniverse/MultimodalUniverse),
a large-scale collection of multimodal astronomical data. For full details, see the paper:
[The Multimodal Universe: Enabling Large-Scale Machine Learning with 100TBs of Astronomical Scientific Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02527).

### Access the catalog

We recommend the use of the [LSDB](https://lsdb.io) Python framework to access HATS catalogs.
LSDB can be installed via `pip install lsdb` or `conda install conda-forge::lsdb`,
see more details [in the docs](https://docs.lsdb.io/).
The following code provides a minimal example of opening this catalog:

```python
import lsdb

# Full sky coverage.
catalog = lsdb.open_catalog("https://huggingface.co/datasets/UniverseTBD/mmu_ssl_legacysurvey_north")
# One-degree cone.
catalog = lsdb.open_catalog(
    "https://huggingface.co/datasets/UniverseTBD/mmu_ssl_legacysurvey_north",
    search_filter=lsdb.ConeSearch(ra=150.0, dec=40.0, radius_arcsec=3600.0),
)
```

Each catalog in this collection is represented as a separate [Apache Parquet dataset](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/dataset.html) and can be accessed with a variety of tools, including `pandas`, `pyarrow`, `dask`, `Spark`, `DuckDB`.

"Nested" indicates whether the column is stored as a nested field inside another "struct" column.


"Value count" may be different from the total number of rows for nested columns: each nested element is counted as a single value.




### Crossmatch with another catalog

HATS catalogs can be efficiently crossmatched using [LSDB](https://lsdb.io),
which leverages the HEALPix partitioning to avoid loading the full datasets into memory:

```python
import lsdb

mmu_ssl_legacysurvey_north = lsdb.open_catalog("https://huggingface.co/datasets/UniverseTBD/mmu_ssl_legacysurvey_north")
other = lsdb.open_catalog("https://huggingface.co/datasets/<org>/<other_catalog>")

crossmatched = mmu_ssl_legacysurvey_north.crossmatch(other, radius_arcsec=1.0)
print(crossmatched)
```

See the [LSDB documentation](https://docs.lsdb.io/) for more details on crossmatching and other operations.

### Dataset-specific context

**Original survey**  
This dataset is based on the northern sky component of the Legacy Surveys Data Release 9. It includes (g, r, z) images from the Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey (BASS) and the Mayall z-band Legacy Survey (MzLS), processed through the Legacy Surveys pipeline.

**Data modality**  
The dataset consists of 15 million galaxy image cutouts (152 × 152 pixels) in three optical bands (g, r, z) at a pixel scale of 0.262 arcsec. Each image is associated with measurements from the Legacy Survey catalog.

**Typical use cases**  
This dataset was used to build a self-supervised representation learning model, to identify strong gravitational lensing, and to develop an image-spectrum contrastive learning model.

**Caveats**  
The dataset includes galaxies selected based on specific criteria (extended objects, magnitude cuts, and quality flags). No further processing is applied beyond the original dataset.

**Citation**  
Users should cite the data compilation paper and include the official acknowledgment provided by the [Legacy Surveys](https://www.legacysurvey.org/acknowledgment/#toc-entry-2)
